## Why Rocket?

There are many Restful API request tools available today, such as Postman, Apifox, etc.... However, in some special control environment, the installation of these requesting software in the relevant equipment has to go through several layers of verification and validation. Because of such stringent conditions, Rocket was created.

Rocket is a Restful API request tool developed purely based on Powershell. While device installed with .NET runtime and powershell, users can quickly test the Restful API through the GUI interface provided by Rocket, and record the test results for later analysis.
